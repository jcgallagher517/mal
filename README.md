# mal - Make a Lisp

This is my own implementation of mal, a Clojure inspired Lisp dialect, in C. 
There is a guided process enumarated in the [original repository](https://github.com/kanaka/mal), 
as well as dozens of implementations in many different languages.

Since there were a couple of C implementations already, 
and since, as a novice developer, my implementation is unlikely to be an improvement on the others,
I have decided to keep my code entirely separete from the original repository. 
But please do check out the original repository for more information!

I have retained the test suite and some documentation from the original repo here.
