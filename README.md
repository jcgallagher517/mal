# mal - Make a Lisp

This is my own implementation of mal, a Clojure inspired Lisp dialect that primarily serves as a language-learning tool, in C.
There is an 11-step guided process enumerated in the [original repository](https://github.com/kanaka/mal),
as well as dozens of implementations in many different languages.

Since there were a couple of C implementations already,
and since, as a novice developer, my implementation is unlikely to be an improvement on the others,
I have decided to keep my code entirely separate from the original repository.
However, I have retained the test suite and lib here.
But please do check out the original repository for more information!
