# mal - Make a Lisp

This is my own implementation of mal, a Clojure inspired Lisp dialect that primarily serves as a language-learning tool.
I am working currently on implementations in Ruby, and maybe later I will try C.
There is an 11-step guided process enumerated in the [original repository](https://github.com/kanaka/mal),
as well as dozens of implementations in many different languages.

Since there were other implementations in my target languages, and since as a novice developer, mine are unlikely to be an improvement from the others,
I have decided to keep my work entirely separate from the main repo.
But please do check out the original repository for more information!
